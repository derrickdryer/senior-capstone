## Group Name: Byte Me

### Members

- Derrick Dryer
- Kolson DeSocio
- Sarah Cusick

### Project

The objective of this project is to develop a professional realtor website that enables users to browse and search property listings, while administrators can manage the listings through a secure backend. The site will feature a clean and intuitive interface for users, providing key details about available properties. The backend will include administrative access for managing property data. The project will emphasize scalability, maintainability, and easy deployment, ensuring the system can grow as needed.

#### Languages/Technologies

- **Node.js:** Powers the back-end API, handling property listings, administrative tasks, and database interactions.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Provides cloud hosting, data storage, and security for scalable deployment.
- **Oracle Database:** Stores and manages property listings with high reliability and performance.
- **Docker:** The application will be containerized using Docker, ensuring a consistent environment across development, staging, and production.

### Additional technologies/languages will be added on a 'as required' basis

## Goals for the Course

- **Demonstrate effective communication & documentation skills** by delivering clear project reports, user manuals, and presentations.
- **Gain hands-on experience with various technologies technologies & languages.** E.g. Node.js, Docker, AWS, Git, Github, etc.
- **Enhance project management and collaboration skills** by applying Agile or Scrum methodologies to a team project.
- **Apply data analysis and database management skills** in designing and implementing a robust back-end system.

## Communication and Management Procedures

### Synchronous Meetings

- Mondays and Wednesdays at 3:00pm
  - Bi-Weekly in person on Wednesdays
  - Weekly Teams meetings on Mondays

### Asynchronous Communication: [Specify preferred platforms]

- **Microsoft Teams:** General communication, video meetings & sharing of files.
- **Jira/Github Projects:** Project/Task Management
- **Call/Text:** Communication if required or to contact another member immediately.

## Sharing Work and Resources

### Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams will be used for file sharing, organizing group documents, and hosting virtual meetings when necessary. It will also serve as a hub for asynchronous discussions.

### Jira/Github Projects

Jira/Github Projects will be used for Agile project management, tracking progress through user stories, sprints, and backlog management. Each member will log tasks, update their progress, and move issues through the workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Regular sprint planning and retrospectives will be facilitated through Jira to ensure milestones are met.

### GitHub

GitHub will be used for version control and code collaboration. Each group member will be responsible for committing their changes regularly and reviewing pull requests before merging to the main branch. GitHub Issues will be used to track tasks and bugs.

## Expectations of Group Members

### Meeting Attendance

All members are expected to attend every scheduled meeting unless prior notice is given at least 24 hours in advance, unless it is an emergency. Consistent attendance is crucial for maintaining project momentum and ensuring equal contribution.

### Meeting Preparation

Each member is required to come prepared for meetings by reviewing prior tasks, progress, and agenda items. This includes completing assigned tasks, being ready to discuss blockers, and having questions or feedback prepared.

### Methods of Communication

Group members should use Microsoft Teams or call/text for communication depending on the urgency of the matter. All formal project discussions and updates should be conducted in Microsoft Teams to maintain a clear record.

### Frequency of Communication

Members should communicate progress updates at least twice a week, particularly when tasks are completed or if any blockers arise. Active participation in both synchronous and asynchronous communication is expected.

### Response Speed of Communication

Members are expected to respond to messages within 24 hours for non-urgent matters and within 2 hours for urgent issues during working hours (e.g., 9 AM to 6 PM, Monday through Friday).

### Communication Skills

All communication should be respectful, concise, and clear. Feedback should be constructive, and misunderstandings should be addressed immediately to avoid delays.

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts will be addressed promptly and professionally. If a disagreement arises, the following steps will be taken:

1. A group discussion will be initiated, allowing each member to express their concerns and perspectives respectfully.
2. If the issue remains unresolved, the group will vote on the best course of action.
3. If a consensus cannot be reached, the group will escalate the issue to the capstone project advisor or instructor for mediation.
4. All conflicts should be addressed within 48 hours to prevent project delays.

## Rotation of Responsibilities

### Meeting Moderator

The role of Meeting Moderator will rotate on a weekly basis. Each member will be responsible for leading the meeting, setting the agenda, and ensuring the meeting stays on track. The rotation will follow this order:

- **Week 1:** Derrick Dryer
- **Week 2:** Kolson DeSocio
- **Week 3:** Sarah Cusick
- *The rotation will continue in this order throughout the project.*

### Note Taker

The Note Taker will also rotate on a weekly basis. This member will be responsible for documenting meeting minutes, key decisions, and action items. The rotation schedule will follow the same order as the Meeting Moderator:

- **Week 1:** Kolson DeSocio
- **Week 2:** Sarah Cusick
- **Week 3:** Derrick Dryer
- *The rotation will continue in this order throughout the project.*

## Additional Project Roles

Each group member will take on specific roles that align with their strengths and expertise. These roles are designed to ensure that all aspects of the project are handled efficiently.

- **Project Manager:** Responsible for overseeing the entire project timeline, managing tasks, and ensuring the team stays on track with deliverables. The Project Manager will coordinate meetings, facilitate communication, and handle any administrative duties related to the project.

- **Git Expert:** In charge of managing the version control system (GitHub). This member will ensure that code is properly committed, branches are maintained, and conflicts are resolved. They will also provide support to other team members in using Git and reviewing pull requests.

- **Quality Assurance (QA):** Focuses on testing the project deliverables to ensure they meet the required standards. The QA role includes writing test cases, performing manual/automated tests, and reporting bugs or issues. They will work closely with developers to resolve any identified problems.

- **Front-End Developer:** Specializes in designing and developing the user interface and user experience. This role involves working on the visual elements of the project using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Vue). They ensure the application is user-friendly and responsive.

- **Back-End Developer:** Responsible for the server-side logic, database management, and API development. This role focuses on ensuring that the application performs efficiently and securely. They will work with databases, server frameworks, and handle data flow between the front-end and back-end systems.
