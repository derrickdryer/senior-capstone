## Introduction

Our team is working on a service-learning project to analyze a series of disparate business processes in order to redesign into an optimized and streamlined information systems (software) solution by considering technical, user & business requirements. We will then apply a software development methodology to develop and implement the information systems (software) solution. Lastly, our team will produce a software installation support and systems users' manual for this system.

For inquiries, please email <contact@derrickdryer.com>
